# 🔁 Recursive Palindromic Substrings Finder in C++

This C++ program identifies and prints **all palindromic substrings of length 2 or more** within a given input string using a **recursive approach**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this program is to demonstrate how **recursion** can be effectively used to solve a common string-processing problem — identifying **palindromes**. A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same forwards and backwards (e.g., `madam`, `racecar`, or `abba`).

This tool can be useful for:
- Practicing recursive thinking and string manipulation in C++
- Algorithm teaching or learning
- Use in text analysis or pattern recognition tasks

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user inputs a string.
2. The program checks **every possible substring of length ≥ 2**.
3. For each substring, it calls a **recursive function** to determine whether it is a palindrome.
4. All palindromic substrings found are stored and then displayed to the user.
